Victoria University EES4100 Test Suite

This repository builds three applications:

bacnet_client:
    This application will continually poll for devices with subdirectories in
    RANDOM_DATA_POOL. Once a device has been found, it will send a
    Read_Property request to as many Analog_Input object instances as required
    by the data in the device's RANDOM_DATA_POOL.

    bacnet_client acts as a BBMD and expects register_with_bbmd requests.

bacnet_server:
    An incomplete implementation of a Modbus to BACnet bridge. (The modbus code
    is missing completely). Use this as a basis for your project.

    It is currently configured to send test_data (matching the data for device
    12 in RANDOM_DATA_POOL) to demonstrate the matching requirements for
    bacnet_client.

modbus_server:
    The Modbus server that expects connections from bacnet_server. It will
    provide data as provided by RANDOM_DATA_POOL. The BACnet device number to
    register number mapping is as follows:
	
	BACnet Side			Modbus Side

	Device 12 AI Instance 0		Register 12
	Device 12 AI Instance 1		Register 13
	Device 12 AI Instance 2		Register 14
	Device 120 AI Instance 0	Register 120 ...
